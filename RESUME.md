# RESUME — where we left off

**Last touched:** 2026-05-11 (Phase 1 plan ready, execution paused for time)
**Branch:** `refactor/v2` (off main `d50a2bc`, **not yet pushed**)
**Status:** ⏸️ **Paused — plan revisions recommended before executing.** Design approved + revised after verification, Phase 1 plan written + reviewed + fixed. On 2026-05-30 a 64-agent red-team of the go-forward plan ran (see below) and surfaced **5 critical blockers** that should be folded into the design doc / Phase 1-3 plans before executing. Next session: decide which backlog items to action, revise the plan, then pick Subagent-Driven vs Inline execution. Nothing in this repo has been changed by Phase 1 yet — only `docs/` files.

**Working-tree state at pause:** docs committed on `refactor/v2` (commits `e81ba45`, plus the backlog commit). Untracked: `.idea/`, `Functions/__pycache__/`, `.claude/` (left out deliberately — no `.gitignore` yet). Branch has not been pushed to GitHub.

## 🔴 NEW (2026-05-30): red-team backlog — READ BEFORE EXECUTING

A 64-agent workflow (`v2-improvement-redteam`) red-teamed the **go-forward** plan (not v1), reading all prior audit/verification reports as input. Output: **`docs/audit/v2-improvement-backlog.md`** (28 prioritized items, 42 findings raised / 37 survived / 5 refuted). **Read it before executing Phase 1.**

**5 critical blockers (would stop the MVP backtest from running at all):**
1. **`fridays_between()` drops the 33 quarter-start vintages** the DFM re-estimates params on → Phase 4 can't reproduce `Results.pdf`. Fix the vintage list + change Phase 2 exit criterion to a superset assertion (≥485 filenames, all present). *(Phase 2/4)*
2. **Phase 2 is mis-scoped:** there is **no v1 fetcher for 32 of 35 series** (`variables_creation.py` only patches the 3 fiscal ones). Re-scope as *building* a new ALFRED fetcher, re-budget 4-6 d, add a pre-Phase-2 go/no-go ALFRED-coverage spike. *(Phase 2)*
3. **Golden baseline must be frozen from UNMODIFIED v1 before de-MATLAB.** Split Phase 3 → 3a (freeze, commit `golden/` + SHA) / 3b (refactor), hard gate between. *(Phase 3)*
4. **Headline "non-redundant but not significant" is an underpowered failure-to-reject** (T≈10-30) with zero power/MDE analysis. Make sample size THE framing device (MDE / equivalence / TOST). *(Phase 4/6/8)*
5. **Phase 7a "COVID factor + outlier vector" is severed from the SV/Bayesian machinery that identifies it** (the plan excludes both). Re-spec as an identifiable outlier/dummy device with identification-aware exit criteria. *(Phase 7a, partial)*

**Nearly-free high-leverage sequencing fixes:** move the backtest runner Phase 5 → Phase 3 so Phase 4's re-run is executable (rank 4); don't deploy the public Streamlit MVP with no GDPNow/ARMA benchmark — pull benchmarks forward or unlist (rank 7); commit recovered `update_Nowcast.py` in Phase 1 so the repo runs on clone (rank 24).

**Notable refutations (verification protected the plan):** the "DM loss-differential sign mixup" and "must add HAC" findings were both **refuted** — verifiers checked Appendix C + code and confirmed the plan's quarterly-HLN approach is correct and HAC is a ~no-op at h=1. Don't re-open those.

## What this is

A complete revision (v2) of the master thesis project `GDPnowcast-fiscal`. Goal: research-grade re-do targeting **portfolio piece first, working paper second**. Triggered by a 3-agent audit on 2026-05-11 that found:

- DFM core is **correct** (faithful port of FRBNY Banbura-Modugno DFM)
- ~85% of root-level Python is **near-duplicate** (18 nowcast scripts, 2 dashboards)
- **Four candidate methodology bugs.** Verification (2026-05-11) outcome: 2 confirmed (MTSDS133FMS un-deseasonalised; DM at weekly granularity, plus stacked bug: plain `ttest_1samp` despite Appendix C claiming HAC), 1 partially confirmed (W875RX1 mislabel yes, redundancy refuted on `pch`), 1 refuted (GCEC1 shift is the fix, not the bug). See `docs/audit/v1-verified/00_synthesis.md`.
- `Functions/update_Nowcast.py` is **missing from HEAD** but **recoverable from git** (`git show 729b40b:Functions/update_Nowcast.py`, 431 lines, accidentally deleted in `e0928d5`).
- FRED API key committed in plaintext (burned — to rotate in Phase 1 Task 3).

## What's next (in order)

### Immediate (next session) — ⚠️ CHANGED 2026-05-30:

**Do NOT jump straight to executing Phase 1.** The red-team backlog surfaced 5 critical blockers (see 🔴 section above) that change Phase 2-3 scope/budget. Next action is to **triage the backlog and revise the plan first**:

1. **Triage `docs/audit/v2-improvement-backlog.md`** with Matteo — voce per voce for the confirmed/high items: accept / defer / drop. The 5 critical + the 3 "nearly-free sequencing" items (ranks 4, 7, 24) are the priority.
2. **Revise the docs** to fold accepted items in: `docs/plans/2026-05-11-v2-design.md` (re-scope Phase 2 fetcher, split Phase 3 → 3a/3b, move runner into Phase 3, Phase 7a COVID re-spec, power/MDE narrative) and `docs/plans/2026-05-11-phase1-implementation.md` (e.g. rank 24: commit recovered `update_Nowcast.py` in Phase 1; README/CI items). Re-budget the roadmap ETAs.
3. **THEN execute Phase 1** on the revised plan.

Open question for Matteo at resume: does he want me to revise the plan docs directly, or triage item-by-item together first? (He leaned step-by-step; I recommended revising the confirmed criticals and triaging the partials #5/#7 together.)

**Then — Execute Phase 1** — `docs/plans/2026-05-11-phase1-implementation.md` (as revised). 13 tasks, ~10-15 commits, TDD on the smoke test. Tooling: `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pre-commit`, `just`, GitHub Actions.

Two execution paths to choose from:
- **Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — dispatch one subagent per task with review between. Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Faster iteration, isolated context per task.
- **Inline** — work tasks sequentially in the active session. Use `superpowers:executing-plans`. Natural checkpoints at Task 3 (FRED-key rotation = security-critical, manual browser step) and Task 13 (final exit-criteria verification).

**Prerequisites the engineer must install before starting** (per plan header):
- Python 3.13 (`python --version` → `3.13.x`)
- `uv` ≥ 0.5 (`uv --version`)
- `just` (`just --version`)
- A signed-in FRED account at fred.stlouisfed.org (the OLD key `64b47ef…` must be revoked in Task 3 Step 1 — manual browser step).

### Design-doc decisions captured 2026-05-11 (post-verification):
- Bug #1 (GCEC1 shift) — **dropped from Phase 4.** Replaced by a unit test on `pca(GDPC1)` vs BEA growth.
- Bug #4 (W875RX1) — **left as-is in spec.** No category rename, no drop. The taxonomic mislabel debate is parked.
- Bug #3 (DM) — **Quarterly + HLN only.** HAC implementation is out of scope (v1 code never had it).
- Phase 3 — `update_Nowcast.py` **recovered from git `729b40b`**, not re-derived from upstream.

### Phase roadmap (from design doc §3):

| # | Phase | ETA |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation (skeleton + tooling + FRED key rotation) | 1-2 d |
| 2 | Data pipeline (FRED/ALFRED rebuild) | 2-3 d |
| 3 | Library migration + tests (de-MATLAB, fix v1 bugs) | 3-4 d |
| 4 | **Methodology fixes** (the 4 bugs from the audit) | 2-3 d |
| 5 | Portfolio polish (1 CLI, 1 dashboard, deploy) | 2-3 d |
| — | **Portfolio MVP complete** | |
| 6 | Validation rigor (benchmarks, encompassing, holdout, intervals) | 3-4 d |
| 7a | Staff Nowcast 2.0: COVID factor | 1-2 d |
| 7b | Staff Nowcast 2.0: long-run trend (optional) | 2-3 d |
| 8 | Paper writing | 5-7 d |

## How to resume from a fresh Claude session

In PyCharm terminal, from this repo root:

```bash
claude
```

Then say something like:

> "I'm resuming the GDPnowcast-fiscal v2 refactor. Read RESUME.md (especially the 🔴 red-team section at the top) and `docs/audit/v2-improvement-backlog.md`. Before executing Phase 1 we need to triage the backlog and revise the design doc + Phase 1 plan to fold in the 5 critical blockers. Let's start by triaging the confirmed/high items together, then revise the plan, then execute."

Claude will pick up from there. Do NOT skip the design-doc, verification, and red-team-backlog reading — they explain why specific tasks exist and what must change before execution.

**Current branch tip:** `87ae1ef` on `refactor/v2` (not pushed). Working tree clean except deliberately-untracked `.idea/`, `Functions/__pycache__/`, `.claude/`.

---

## Decisions already locked (from brainstorming)

- **Scope:** Re-do completo, research-grade.
- **End goal:** Portfolio first, paper second.
- **Data:** Gitignored + rebuild from FRED/ALFRED via `gdpnowcast fetch`. Excel format preserved.
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, `uv` (conda fallback), Typer CLI, Streamlit dashboard, pytest, ruff, mypy non-strict, GitHub Actions, `justfile`.
- **Structure:** `src/gdpnowcast/` layout. `dfm.py` single file (split deferred). No `scripts/` dir — CLI via Typer.
- **Methodology Phase 4 (revised post-verification):** Two fixes shipped (MTSDS133FMS → `ch1` (fallback X-13); quarterly final-week DM with HLN small-sample correction, rewrite in `src/gdpnowcast/analysis/diebold_mariano.py`) + one regression test (`pca(GDPC1)` vs BEA-published Q-over-Q growth). Bug #1 (GCEC1 shift) and Bug #4 (W875RX1) dropped from Phase 4 scope. HAC variance deliberately out of scope (v1 never had it; matching Appendix C is a separate scope expansion).
- **Methodology Phase 6:** GDPNow + ARMA + encompassing + holdout (2017-22 train / 2023-25 test) + predictive intervals. SPF best-effort.
- **Methodology Phase 7:** COVID factor mandatory (Phase 7a), long-run trend optional (Phase 7b). Bayesian/TVP excluded.
- **Final comparison:** **6 models** — v1, fixed-no-fiscal, fixed-with-fiscal (3 fiscal vars kept), +COVID factor, GDPNow, ARMA.

## Important caveats

1. **`Results.pdf` numbers are reproducible *with* the recovered `update_Nowcast.py`** (`git show 729b40b:Functions/update_Nowcast.py > Functions/update_Nowcast.py`). At HEAD of the public repo the pipeline is broken — that's a fixable on-clone gap, not a permanent loss.
2. **Phase 4 fixes will likely collapse the "Q2 and post-2020 fiscal effect" headline.** The verification confirms April is +1.13σ on raw `lin` and `ch1` shrinks it to 0.12σ; the DM significance also collapses (6.4 → ~1.46 borderline). Honest narrative shift expected: from "fiscal significantly improves nowcasting" → "fiscal carries non-redundant transfer-cleaned income signal but is not significant at conventional thresholds".
3. **FRED API key in v1 is burned.** Rotation is Task 3 of the Phase 1 plan (manual browser step at fred.stlouisfed.org).
4. **Dashboard deploy** can't do live FRED fetches on Streamlit Cloud (ephemeral disk, secrets management). The Phase 5 design reads from pre-computed `docs/dashboard_data/`.
