# RESUME — where we left off

**Last touched:** 2026-05-11 (Phase 1 plan ready, execution paused for time)
**Branch:** `refactor/v2` (off main `d50a2bc`, **not yet pushed**)
**Status:** ⏸️ **Paused — ready to execute Phase 1.** Design approved + revised after verification, Phase 1 plan written + reviewed + fixed. Next session: pick Subagent-Driven vs Inline execution, then run the plan. Nothing in this repo has been changed by Phase 1 yet — only `docs/` files have been added/edited.

**Working-tree state at pause:** clean tree on `refactor/v2`. Uncommitted v2 work so far (audit verification + design-doc revisions + Phase 1 plan) is committed inside `docs/`. Branch has not been pushed to GitHub.

## What this is

A complete revision (v2) of the master thesis project `GDPnowcast-fiscal`. Goal: research-grade re-do targeting **portfolio piece first, working paper second**. Triggered by a 3-agent audit on 2026-05-11 that found:

- DFM core is **correct** (faithful port of FRBNY Banbura-Modugno DFM)
- ~85% of root-level Python is **near-duplicate** (18 nowcast scripts, 2 dashboards)
- **Four candidate methodology bugs.** Verification (2026-05-11) outcome: 2 confirmed (MTSDS133FMS un-deseasonalised; DM at weekly granularity, plus stacked bug: plain `ttest_1samp` despite Appendix C claiming HAC), 1 partially confirmed (W875RX1 mislabel yes, redundancy refuted on `pch`), 1 refuted (GCEC1 shift is the fix, not the bug). See `docs/audit/v1-verified/00_synthesis.md`.
- `Functions/update_Nowcast.py` is **missing from HEAD** but **recoverable from git** (`git show 729b40b:Functions/update_Nowcast.py`, 431 lines, accidentally deleted in `e0928d5`).
- FRED API key committed in plaintext (burned — to rotate in Phase 1 Task 3).

## What's already done

- [x] Repo cloned locally to `C:\Users\Matteo17\OneDrive\Desktop\Repos\GDPnowcast-fiscal`
- [x] Branch `refactor/v2` created (not yet pushed)
- [x] 3-agent audit complete — reports in `docs/audit/v1/`:
  - `00_synthesis.md` — unified synthesis (READ FIRST)
  - `01_structure_audit.md` — folder structure + reproducibility
  - `02_code_quality_audit.md` — Python code quality
  - `03_methodology_audit.md` — statistical/econometric correctness
- [x] Brainstorming complete (scope, end-goal, data strategy, phasing, structure, stack, methodology)
- [x] Design doc written: `docs/plans/2026-05-11-v2-design.md` (READ SECOND)
- [x] **Audit findings verified (2026-05-11)** — 5 parallel agents, reports in `docs/audit/v1-verified/`:
  - `00_synthesis.md` — **READ THIRD** — consolidated outcomes + impacts on the design doc
  - Bug #1 (GCEC1 shift): **REFUTED** — the shift is the fix, not the bug
  - Bug #2 (MTSDS133FMS `lin`): CONFIRMED (April = +1.13σ; `ch1` shrinks to 0.12σ)
  - Bug #3 (DM weekly): CONFIRMED + **stacked bug** — code uses plain `ttest_1samp`, no HAC, despite Appendix C claiming HAC
  - Bug #4 (W875RX1): **PARTIALLY** — mislabel yes; redundancy refuted on `pch` (r=0.09). Decision: keep as-is.
  - Reproducibility: CONFIRMED + `update_Nowcast.py` **recoverable from git `729b40b`**
- [x] **Design doc revised + reviewed (2026-05-11)** — reviewer agent found 4 Critical + 3 Important contradictions left over from the pre-verification draft; all fixed in `docs/plans/2026-05-11-v2-design.md`. Review report at `docs/audit/v1-verified/06_design_doc_review.md`.
- [x] **Phase 1 implementation plan written + reviewed + fixed (2026-05-11)** — at `docs/plans/2026-05-11-phase1-implementation.md`. 13 tasks. Reviewer agent (`docs/audit/v1-verified/07_phase1_plan_review.md`) found 2 Critical bugs (indentation in the FRED-key patch; incomplete grep filter in exit criterion E) and 1 wording issue — all three fixed.

## What's next (in order)

### Immediate (next session):

**Execute Phase 1** — `docs/plans/2026-05-11-phase1-implementation.md`. 13 tasks, ~10-15 commits, TDD on the smoke test. Tooling: `uv`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pre-commit`, `just`, GitHub Actions.

Two execution paths to choose from:
- **Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — dispatch one subagent per task with review between. Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Faster iteration, isolated context per task.
- **Inline** — work tasks sequentially in the active session. Use `superpowers:executing-plans`. Natural checkpoints at Task 3 (FRED-key rotation = security-critical, manual browser step) and Task 13 (final exit-criteria verification).

**Prerequisites the engineer must install before starting** (per plan header):
- Python 3.13 (`python --version` → `3.13.x`)
- `uv` ≥ 0.5 (`uv --version`)
- `just` (`just --version`)
- A signed-in FRED account at fred.stlouisfed.org (the OLD key `64b47ef…` must be revoked in Task 3 Step 1 — manual browser step).

### Design-doc decisions captured 2026-05-11 (post-verification):
- Bug #1 (GCEC1 shift) — **dropped from Phase 4.** Replaced by a unit test on `pca(GDPC1)` vs BEA growth.
- Bug #4 (W875RX1) — **left as-is in spec.** No category rename, no drop. The taxonomic mislabel debate is parked.
- Bug #3 (DM) — **Quarterly + HLN only.** HAC implementation is out of scope (v1 code never had it).
- Phase 3 — `update_Nowcast.py` **recovered from git `729b40b`**, not re-derived from upstream.

### Phase roadmap (from design doc §3):

| # | Phase | ETA |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation (skeleton + tooling + FRED key rotation) | 1-2 d |
| 2 | Data pipeline (FRED/ALFRED rebuild) | 2-3 d |
| 3 | Library migration + tests (de-MATLAB, fix v1 bugs) | 3-4 d |
| 4 | **Methodology fixes** (the 4 bugs from the audit) | 2-3 d |
| 5 | Portfolio polish (1 CLI, 1 dashboard, deploy) | 2-3 d |
| — | **Portfolio MVP complete** | |
| 6 | Validation rigor (benchmarks, encompassing, holdout, intervals) | 3-4 d |
| 7a | Staff Nowcast 2.0: COVID factor | 1-2 d |
| 7b | Staff Nowcast 2.0: long-run trend (optional) | 2-3 d |
| 8 | Paper writing | 5-7 d |

## How to resume from a fresh Claude session

In PyCharm terminal, from this repo root:

```bash
claude
```

Then say something like:

> "I'm resuming the GDPnowcast-fiscal v2 refactor. Read RESUME.md to see where we paused, then read `docs/plans/2026-05-11-phase1-implementation.md` and execute Phase 1 via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (one subagent per task, review between). I'll do Task 3 Step 1 (FRED-key rotation in the browser) manually when you reach it."

Claude will pick up from there. Do NOT skip the design-doc and verification reading — they explain why specific tasks exist.

---

## Decisions already locked (from brainstorming)

- **Scope:** Re-do completo, research-grade.
- **End goal:** Portfolio first, paper second.
- **Data:** Gitignored + rebuild from FRED/ALFRED via `gdpnowcast fetch`. Excel format preserved.
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, `uv` (conda fallback), Typer CLI, Streamlit dashboard, pytest, ruff, mypy non-strict, GitHub Actions, `justfile`.
- **Structure:** `src/gdpnowcast/` layout. `dfm.py` single file (split deferred). No `scripts/` dir — CLI via Typer.
- **Methodology Phase 4 (revised post-verification):** Two fixes shipped (MTSDS133FMS → `ch1` (fallback X-13); quarterly final-week DM with HLN small-sample correction, rewrite in `src/gdpnowcast/analysis/diebold_mariano.py`) + one regression test (`pca(GDPC1)` vs BEA-published Q-over-Q growth). Bug #1 (GCEC1 shift) and Bug #4 (W875RX1) dropped from Phase 4 scope. HAC variance deliberately out of scope (v1 never had it; matching Appendix C is a separate scope expansion).
- **Methodology Phase 6:** GDPNow + ARMA + encompassing + holdout (2017-22 train / 2023-25 test) + predictive intervals. SPF best-effort.
- **Methodology Phase 7:** COVID factor mandatory (Phase 7a), long-run trend optional (Phase 7b). Bayesian/TVP excluded.
- **Final comparison:** **6 models** — v1, fixed-no-fiscal, fixed-with-fiscal (3 fiscal vars kept), +COVID factor, GDPNow, ARMA.

## Important caveats

1. **`Results.pdf` numbers are reproducible *with* the recovered `update_Nowcast.py`** (`git show 729b40b:Functions/update_Nowcast.py > Functions/update_Nowcast.py`). At HEAD of the public repo the pipeline is broken — that's a fixable on-clone gap, not a permanent loss.
2. **Phase 4 fixes will likely collapse the "Q2 and post-2020 fiscal effect" headline.** The verification confirms April is +1.13σ on raw `lin` and `ch1` shrinks it to 0.12σ; the DM significance also collapses (6.4 → ~1.46 borderline). Honest narrative shift expected: from "fiscal significantly improves nowcasting" → "fiscal carries non-redundant transfer-cleaned income signal but is not significant at conventional thresholds".
3. **FRED API key in v1 is burned.** Rotation is Task 3 of the Phase 1 plan (manual browser step at fred.stlouisfed.org).
4. **Dashboard deploy** can't do live FRED fetches on Streamlit Cloud (ephemeral disk, secrets management). The Phase 5 design reads from pre-computed `docs/dashboard_data/`.
